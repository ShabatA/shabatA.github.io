Currently the head of Data Science Lab at Risk Insights, I holds extensive experience in data
science, artificial intelligence, and machine learning algorithms. I have developed, designed, and
implemented various cutting-edge models in numerous industries (Telecommunication, Security and
Retails). With a PhD in Artificial intelligence in the field of computer vision from the University of
KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, I enjoyed addressing an audience as a Senior Lecturer for seven
years at Durban University Technology. Combining academic and industry experience, I equally
enjoys scholarly and commissioned research in Data Science, Computer Vision, 4IR, information
systems, and informatics.
