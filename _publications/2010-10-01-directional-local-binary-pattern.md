In this paper, a new features method, the Directional Local Binary Pattern (DLBP), is presented, with an objective to improve Local Directional Pattern (LDP) for texture analysis. The idea of Directional DLBP is inspired by the stability of the Kirsch mask directional responses and the LBP neighboring concept. The result shows that Directional Local Binary Pattern outperforms LDP and LBP.
