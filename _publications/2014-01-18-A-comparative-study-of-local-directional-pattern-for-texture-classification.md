Texture is an important feature for image analysis in which each pixel is classified based on its neighborhood. It is used for surface characterization in many applications, such as medical imaging, remote sensing and quality control. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the performance for the newly purposed Local directional pattern (LDP) and compared to the popular Gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM). In this paper, texture classification power of two feature methods, Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) and Local Directional Pattern(LDP) are compared. Experiments are conducted on 25 Texture types selected from Brodatz album. Classification are carried out using 4 different classifiers (Naive-bayes(NB), Multilayer Perceptron(MLP), Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-nearest Neighbor Algorithm(k-NN)) in different conditions.
