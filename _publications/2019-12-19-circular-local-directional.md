This paper presents a novel texture feature extraction method, Circular Local Directional Pattern (CILDP), that is inspired by Local Binary pattern (LBP) and Local Directional Pattern (LDP). This method relies on circular shape to compute the directional edge responses based on Kirsch Masks using different radiuses. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using five classifiers on textures from the Kylberg dataset. Results achieved establish that the proposed method consistently outperforms LBP and LDP when different radiuses are considered.
