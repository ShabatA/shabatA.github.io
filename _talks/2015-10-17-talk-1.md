In this tutorial, two main areas will be covered using Textural Images Dataset:

* Textural Features Methods: (Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix(GLCM), Local Binary Pattern(LBP) and Local Directional Pattern(LDP))
* Classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Naive Bayes(NB).


Both Features Extraction and Classification will be implemented using Python.

Texture is a very important factor in computer vision; it represents the first level of spatial properties that can be extracted from digital image. Texture can be defined as relationship between gray level in neighboring pixels.
